## About Myself

I have over four years experience in production systems and supply chain management. I enjoyed my job which improves my abilities in planning, optimization and innovativethinking. Also, leading a team in an international company challenged me to developgood communicational skills. Besides these, I noticed, it is my analytical way of thinking and data-driven approaches that thrill me most and play important role in achievingsuccess in my projects. Thus, I am very eager to continue my career in data science and I believe that my dedicated and quick-learner self will help me on this journey.
